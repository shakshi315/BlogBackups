# What is Linux command do?

Now, let's talk about Linux commands. In Linux, commands are instructions that you give to the operating system using the command-line interface (CLI).

They allow you to perform various tasks, such as managing files and directories, installing software, configuring settings, and interacting with the system.

Think of Linux commands as a way to communicate with your computer using text-based instructions. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and icons, you type commands into a terminal or command prompt.

Each command has a specific purpose and syntax, and when you execute a command, the operating system carries out the corresponding action.
