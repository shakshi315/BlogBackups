File permissions are a set of rules that determine who can do what with a file. They act like a lock and key system for files, controlling access and actions that users can perform on a file. There are three main types of permissions:

1. **Read** (R): Allows a user to view the contents of a file.
    
2. **Write** (W): Enables a user to modify or change the contents of a file.
    
3. **Execute** (X): Grants permission to execute or run a file (for executable files, like scripts or programs).
    

File permissions are usually set for three categories of users:

**Owner**: The user who created the file. They have full control over the file and can modify permissions.

**Group**: Users who belong to the same group as the file. This allows for shared access and collaboration among specific users.

**Others**: Any user who does not fall into the owner or group category. File permissions are represented by a combination of letters (R, W, X) and symbols (e.g., rwx, rw-, r--, etc.), making it easy to identify the access rights for each category of users.

The `chmod` command is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and macOS) to change the permissions of a file or directory, specifically for the "owner," "group," and "others" categories of users.

# **Task 1: Create a simple file and do** `ls -ltr`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690329351698/604acc71-e457-4df1-9435-323f1cded56f.png align="center")

In the above example, we created a file named DevOps.txt and verified its permissions using the ls -ltr command after its creation.

Next, we modified the permissions of the DevOps.txt file using the chmod command.

After changing the permissions, the result is that we have granted read, write, and execute permissions to the user, while no permissions have been assigned to the group and others.

## **Task 2: Write an article about File Permissions in Linux**

Unveiling the Magic of Linux File Permissions: An Enchanting Guide!

Prepare to embark on a journey to unlock the hidden magic of Linux file permissions! Picture them as a mystical lock-and-key system, safeguarding your files and controlling access to their secrets. In this captivating article, we'll reveal the wizardry behind the three main types of permissions and the numeric sorcery that lies within!

1. **The Numeric Incantation:** Each permission (read, write, execute) holds a mysterious numeric charm. The power of read (r) is 5, write (w) is 3, and execute (x) is 1. By weaving these numeric spells together, even the most enigmatic permission combinations will bow to your will. Abra-cadabra! Witness the emergence of rw- (read and write) as 5 (read) + 3 (write) = 8.
    
2. **The Grand Total:** Prepare to witness the ultimate enchantment! To reveal the total permissions for a file or directory, combine the numeric magic of the owner, group, and others. Behold, as the owner's spell of read and write (8) collides with the group's incantation of write-only (3), and others' charms of none (0) add to the mystic mix. The total emerges as 830!
    
3. **Octal Wizardry:** Brace yourself for the mesmerizing Octal realm! Witness as the total permission number unveils its hidden octal form. Transform rw- (8) into 110, -w- (3) into 010, and --- (0) remains untouched. With a flick of the wand, the octal enchantment of 830 unfolds before your eyes.
    
4. **The Mighty 'chmod' Command:** In the realm of Linux, a powerful command named 'chmod' awaits your beck and call. Wield its symbolic sorcery to bestow specific users with permissions. Command the owner to have executed power by chanting "u+x"! Embrace the octal magic and proclaim "chmod 750" to grant the owner read, write, and execute while others get to read and execute.
    
5. **The Power of Recursion:** Venture deeper into the mystical realm with the legendary '-R' option! Unleash its power with 'chmod' to cascade permissions across directories, files, and subdirectories. Watch as your magical changes ripple through the filesystem, leaving a trail of enchantment in their wake!
    
6. **The '777' Mystery:** Beware the fabled '777' spell! Unleashing this almighty power grants everyone read, write, and execute access. But exercise caution! Wield this magic sparingly, reserving it for specific directories like '/tmp,' for its incredible power may open gateways to unexpected vulnerabilities.
    

Are you prepared to become the master of Linux file permissions? Gather your spellbook, don your wizard's robe, and chant along with the magical 'chmod' command. With our enchanting guide, you'll wield the power of knowledge and guard your files with a touch of mystic mastery!

### Task 3: **Read about ACL and try out the commands** `getfacl` and `setfacl`

Linux Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a valuable feature that enhances file and directory access control beyond traditional permissions.  
With ACLs, you can grant specific users and groups individualized access to files. In this article, we'll explore the basics of ACLs and learn how to use the getfacl and setfacl commands to manage them efficiently.

**What are ACLs?**  
ACLs extend the standard Linux permissions, allowing you to assign access rights to more than just the file owner, group, and others. This flexibility enables precise control over file access for various users and groups, ensuring better security and collaboration.

**Using getfacl:**  
The getfacl command is your window to peek into the access control lists of files and directories. With a simple getfacl &lt;filename&gt; command, you can see the detailed ACL information, including who has what type of access.

**Using setfacl:**  
The setfacl command empowers you to modify ACLs and grant specific access permissions. You can add, modify, or remove access for individual users and groups.

Keypoints here to remember:  
`setfacl`: This is the command used to modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux.

1. `-m`: The option indicates that we are modifying the ACL.
    
    * `u` represents the user category for the ACL entry.
        
    * `ec2-user` is the username of the user to whom we are granting access.
        
    * `rw` stands for "read" and "write" permissions to be given to user "ec2-user."  
        `DevOps.txt`: This is the name of the file to which we are applying the new ACL entry.
        
    
    **Removing an ACL entry:**

    In this example, we used `setfacl -x` to remove the ACL entry "u:ec2-user:rw" from "DevOps.txt." After executing this command, the user "ec2-user" will no longer have the "read" and "write" permissions for the specified file.
    
    This is the way Access Control Lists (ACLs) function.
